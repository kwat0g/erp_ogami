ERP SYSTEM – COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT BLUEPRINT
This document serves as a complete, AI-ready blueprint for developing a modern, offline-capable ERP system for a
manufacturing company. This document is intended to be provided to Claude Sonnet 4.5 for full ERP system
generation.
I. Company Context and ERP Design Basis
The company is a manufacturing organization specializing in plastic automotive parts. It has been operating for 29
years, employs around 400 employees, and consists of 11 departments. Current operations rely heavily on manual
processes and Excel files, with limited accounting software usage. Due to weak internet connectivity, the ERP
system must operate reliably in an offline or LAN-based environment.
II. ERP Objectives
The ERP system aims to integrate all departments, reduce manual encoding, eliminate Excel dependency, improve
inventory accuracy, enhance production planning, automate Accounts Payable due-date tracking, and support
management decision-making while operating offline.
III. Functional Requirements
The ERP must support purchasing, inventory, production planning, production execution, quality control,
maintenance, mold management, accounting, HR records, and import/export compliance with approval workflows.
IV. ERP Modules- HRIS – employee records, hiring, attendance, payroll integration- Finance & Accounting – GL, Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, reporting- Purchasing – PR/PO generation, supplier management, approvals- Inventory & Warehouse – stock monitoring, forecasting, delivery- Production Planning & MRP – scheduling and material planning- Manufacturing Execution – work orders, output and downtime tracking- Quality Management – inspections, NCR, rework- Maintenance Management – preventive and corrective maintenance- Mold Management – mold lifecycle and repair history- Import & Export – PEZA and customs documentation
V. Non-Functional Requirements
The system must be secure, scalable, modular, maintainable, support role-based access control, multi-level
approvals, audit logs, daily backups, and offline operation.
VI. System Architecture
The ERP follows a layered modular architecture with MVC implemented per module. Presentation Layer: React +
Tailwind CSS. Application Layer: Next.js API routes. Business Logic Layer: TypeScript services. Data Access
Layer: Repository pattern. Database Layer: MySQL.
VII. Technology Stack
Frontend: TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS. Backend: Next.js API routes. Database: MySQL on local
server.
VIII. Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Accounting (Accounts Payable), Inventory, Purchasing, Production Planning. Phase 2: Production
Execution, Quality Control, Warehouse. Phase 3: Maintenance, HRIS, Mold Management, Import & Export.
IX. Database Design Requirements
The database must be relational and normalized with proper indexing, constraints, transaction support, and audit
trail tables.
X. API Design Requirements
The system must expose modular REST-style APIs per ERP module with authentication, authorization, validation,
and error handling.
XI. User Roles and Access Control
Top Management: approval and dashboards. Department Heads: monitoring and approvals. Staff: data entry.
Accounting: financial control. Warehouse: inventory transactions.
XII. UI / UX DESIGN REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)
The ERP system must have a modern, professional, panelist-friendly UI. It must feature clean layouts, dashboards
with cards and charts, consistent typography, responsive design, intuitive navigation, and a corporate color palette
using Tailwind CSS best practices.
XIII. Final Instruction for AI System
This document must be treated as the single source of truth. Claude Sonnet 4.5 must follow all architectural,
functional, technical, and UI/UX requirements when generating the ERP system.
